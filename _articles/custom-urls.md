Using a custom url for articles is super easy using Carpet.
Just add a `url` field in the front-matter (between the two
`---`).

For example, the yaml front-matter for this article is:

```yaml
---
title: Custom Article Urls
date: Feb 21, 2016
tags:
  - carpet
  - yaml
url: omgomgomg-wut-sweet-url-dis-is
publish: true
---
```
